- Data Validation: Ensuring data accuracy and consistency, handling outliers.
- Data Imputation: Using median, mode, and custom logic for filling missing values.

### Lesson 07 - Introduction to Databases and SQL

Students will learn advanced data cleaning techniques, including regular expressions and data validation. They will also practice imputing missing values.

Topics:
- Introduction to Relational Databases: Basic concepts of relational databases, SQL syntax.
- Basic SQL Queries: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, JOIN.
- Setting Up a Local Database: Introduction to SQLite.

### Lesson 08 - Advanced SQL and Database Integration

Students will learn the basics of relational databases and SQL. They will practice writing SQL queries to select, filter, and sort data.

Topics:
- Advanced SQL: Subqueries, complex joins, aggregation (GROUP BY, HAVING).
sqlite3 for Database Operations: Basics of SQLite without using ORM.
- Intro to SQLAlchemy (optional for advanced learners or Python 200).

### Lesson 09 - Introduction to Web Scraping

Students will learn advanced SQL concepts, such as subqueries and joins. They will also practice using the sqlite3 module to interact with SQLite databases.

Topics:
- Basics of HTML and DOM: Understanding web page structures.
- Web Scraping Tools: Introduction to BeautifulSoup and Requests.
- Ethical Web Scraping: Legal and ethical considerations, robot.txt.

### Lesson 10 - Data Storage and Retrieval

Students will learn about HTML and the DOM, and how to use libraries like BeautifulSoup and Requests to scrape data from websites.

Topics:
- Storing Scraped Data: Saving data to databases, CSV, and JSON files.
- Retrieving Data: Accessing and manipulating stored data using SQL and Pandas.
- Optimizing Data Storage: Choosing between relational and non-relational databases.

### Lesson 11 - Introduction to Data Visualization

Students will learn how to store scraped data in various formats and retrieve it using SQL and Pandas. They will also explore different data storage options.

Topics:
- Introduction to Matplotlib: Creating basic plots (line, bar, histogram).
- Customizing Plots: Labels, titles, legends, and colors.
- Introduction to Seaborn: Creating advanced visualizations (heatmaps, pair plots).

### Lesson 12 -  Advanced Data Visualization Techniques

Students will learn how to create basic data visualizations using Matplotlib and customize them with labels, titles, legends, and colors. They will also be introduced to Seaborn for more advanced visualizations.

Topics:
- Plotting with Pandas: Visualizing data directly from DataFrames.
- Interactive Visualizations: Introduction to Plotly for interactive plotting.
- Dashboards: Creating simple dashboards with Plotly and Dash.
